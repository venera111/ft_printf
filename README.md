# ft_printf

### Implementation of the standard printf function in C
The project must be compiled using a makefile. The task is aimed at understanding the operation of the standard printing function in the C language.
Description of the project tasks in the ft_printf.pdf file

ft_printf gets a string called a format, which can contain a number of placeholders represented after the % character and the type of data conversion (string (str), character (char), int to decimal, int to hexadecimal, etc.) Syntax: %[flags][width][.precision][length]type

Summary of the various types:
| Format        | Data type                 | Type values               |
| ------------- |:-------------------------:| -----------------------:  |
| d, i          | int                       | int as a signed integer   |
| o             | unsigned int              | in octal                  |
| u             | unsigned int              | print decimal             |
| x, X          | unsigned int              | as a hexadecimal number.  |
|               |                           | x uses lower-case letters |
|               |                           | and X uses upper-case     |
| c             | char                      | character                 |
